         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Howl and weep, for a day of lamentation is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon you, a day of woe and miſery if you repent not, you are become as trees in the wilderneſs dry and barren, rotten with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and the people are become like bryars and thorns, which growes under you, which the day of the Lord will burn and conſume, which is coming upon you all ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a thief in the night; repent now while you have time leaſt the day of wrath come upon you, for the Lord hath waited long to be gracious, and ye have rejected his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, and doth reward him evil for good; if any come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you of his Servants, to bear their teſtimony againſt you, (ye are all become like bryars, and like thorns, and like withered branches lopped off the trees, dryed, fit to kindle the fire withal) either with their cloaths on, or with their cloaths off, ye are tormented, and your peace is broken; for the Lord is riſen in his mighty power, for you have been warned from the Lord by his ſervants, by words and by writing, and all theſe hath not wrought upon you; now the Lord God is ſending you ſigns and wonders, ſo that mens hearts ſhall fail with fear, with look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after theſe things that ſhall come upon the earth; Therefore give over your wickedneſs, and come down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the duſt, and cover your lips, for there is no anſwer of God amongſt you, the Lord is leaving you, becauſe you have rejected his Councel; if you ſpeedily repent not, ſudden deſtruction will come unawares, for as it was in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> ſo ſhall it be in the dayes of the Son of man; therefore conſider your wayes, that the Lord give you not over, for the Lord proffers freely, and hath prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and you have rejected and rebelled againſt the Lord; ſo if you repent not, he will bring you to deſtruction, for the decree is gone forth againſt all unrighteouſneſſe, and every tree that brings not forth good fruit muſt be hewen down and caſt into the fire, but ye are almoſt fallen, your
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102136:3"/>time is near an end, the Lord will ſurely plead with you, for you are going on till all may ſee your folly, rending &amp; devouring the Servants of the Lord, both in body and in goods; Oh bluſh and be aſhamed, for the Lord God is coming to lay you naked, and give you ſigns of your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, both Prieſts and people, your profeſſion is abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation unto the Lord while you are out of the life of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, the Lord hath ſpared you long, but now the Lord will bring your deeds and your nakedneſs to the light, that which hath been done in ſecret ſhall be made made manifeſt openly, for your ill ſavour is come up into the noſtrils of the Lord, and he will reward you accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your works, the day is approaching, wherein you ſhall gnaw your tongues for pain, and cry alas, for the day of miſery is coming upon us, and then it will be too late; Therefore now while you have time give over your wickedneſſe, and give over mentioning the Name of the the Lord all ye who are found in iniquity, for the Lord will ſeparate you, ye muſt all depart if you repent not with ſpeed, and turn unto the Lord while the door of mercy is open; for when it is ſhut, you may call and cry and not be heard, for warnings from the Lord in words hath not wrought upon you, nor in writing, and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet believe; Oh conſider, groſs darkneſs is coming over you; had not <hi>Egypt</hi> many ſigns and wonders before the ſeed came forth? you who are ſpiritual <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Sodom,</hi> groſs darkneſs is coming over you, ſo the Lord is giving you a ſign, and yet you will not believe, but hardens your hearts, and ſtiffens your necks, like as your Fathers did, ſo do ye; therefore nothing can be expected to come upon you, but wo and miſery if ye ſpeedily do not repent, ye have many of you builded your neaſts high, and thinks ye are ſafe, with a covering of the Saints words, but all will be too narrow, it will not cover you, the Lord is coming to lay open your nakedneſſe, ye Prieſts this is to you, ye ſhall become like trees in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not ſo much as leaves to cover you withal, but your nakedneſs ſhall appear as my nakedneſs hath done, as a figure unto you and many people; Come down out of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102136:3"/>your imaginations to the light of the Son of God in you, that with it all actions may be brought to light, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and overturned, for the Lord will overturn the ſureſt foundations that you can lay in your imaginations, and God abhors them; Therefore come down to the light of the Son of God that with it you may ſee the way of the Lord, and no longer that it may be fooliſhneſs unto you, for no man gathers graps of thorns; ye are thorny and briery, and thiſtly-natured, the Lord God is coming to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturn and deſtroy; ſo this is a warning unto you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent while you have time, and give over your wicked wayes both Prieſts and people, and give over your bad u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Servants of the Lord, when they come amongſt you in obedience to his ſpirit as ſigns unto your wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſeeing words will not ſerve, nor writing will not ſerve, but ſtill you go on in your wickedneſſe; Oh, fear the Lord God, for it were better that a milſtone were hanged about his neck and caſt into the Sea, then to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the little ones that believe in Chriſt; So conſider what you do to the light of the Son of God, I ſpeak that with it you may all come to be guided into the fear of the Lord, ſo your wicked wayes and words you may come to be redeemed from, and to finde mercy with God while the door of mercy is open; for you are all become as a Wilderneſs not inhabited, and the Children of the Lord paſſing through, is like to be deſtroyed by devouring crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and this is a figure unto you all, for ſo are you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in the ſight of the Lord, envy and murder is in your hearts, as doth appear daily; if any of the Servants of the Lord be moved to bear their Teſtimony againſt your wickedneſſe in your hearts, thirſting after blood; the Lord ſees your wickedneſs, and he will give you blood to drink, for he is turning your water into blood, you ſpiritual Egyptians, who crucifies the Lord afreſh with your wicked wayes and ungodly lives which you go on in, and hate to be reformed, and caſts the Law of God behind your backs, howl and weep, for miſery is coming, and you cannot eſcape unleſs ye ſpeedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; Oh how is the Lord grieved with your abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Lord is weary of your Sabbaths, and your ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102136:4"/>Aſſemblies he cannot away with them, wickedneſs is in your hearts; fear God, and give glory to his Name, for the hour of his judgements is come, wherein he will plead with all unrighteouſneſs, repent repent, a cry is gone forth from the Lord, yea the ſound of the trumpet; ariſe, ye dead, and come to judgement, for the trumpet hath been ſounded in your ears from the Lord of life, and you remain ſtiff-necked and rebellious, and will not take councel at the Lord; ſo ſigns in your ſtreets alſo muſt you have, that you may be left without excuſe in the day when the Lord will come to reckon with you, that you ſhall not ſay you have not been warned, ſo your blood ſhall be upon your own head if you repent not, and the Children of the Lord clear of your blood, who in obedience to his ſpirit hath warned you to repent, for the day of the Lord is at hand, wherein he will reward every man according to his deeds done in the body, whether they be good or evil, and though you be not gathered, my labour ſhall be with my God, &amp; you muſt bear your iniquitie and prophaneneſs, and give an account unto the Lord for all your wicked wayes, and for all your hard ſpeeches that ever you have ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord and againſt his ſervants, which in obedience to his ſpirit he warned you time after time, and yet you continue in your rebellion; ſo the Lord is wearie of you becauſe of your iniquity, and will ſurely puniſh you in his anger if you continue ſtiff-necked and rebellious againſt him; for ye are all become like waters, unſtabled, unſetled, but you ſhall not overflow the banks; The Lord hath ſet bounds to the ſea, and he will make it ſtand as a wall, and be divided that his ſeed may paſs thorow, and this is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery to you who are in the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> bondage, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting your ſelves in your fleſh-pots and onyons of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> in pride and wantonneſs, and all manner of iniquity and profaneneſs, you are become like <hi>Sodom;</hi> Therefore haſte to meet the Lord, return unto his light wch will ſhew you your dark wayes, and worſhips which you are found in, which the Lord is weary of; for you are an unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people, you are not ſalted at all, the ſalt hath loſt its ſaltneſs, and ye are good for nothing, but to be caſt out
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102136:4"/>and trodden of men in the ſtreets; Therefore turn to the light of Jeſus, and with it you will ſee your ſelves to be in that ſtate, and nature that is aforementioned, &amp; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be hid from the ſword, ſtorm, and hail, which your heads lie open too, and cannot be covered in this the day of the Lords battel againſt you, your oppreſſion, your wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, perſecution, priſoning till death the ſaints and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the moſt High God for your bellies, and that you have done againſt them, you have done againſt Chriſt, and have fought againſt him, the Lord who now is riſen againſt you, and he hath drawn his ſword againſt you, and his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows his quiver full; The darts of the wicked hath been long ſhot at the righteous, but now they ſhall be found all naked men without the weapons and armour of the Lord God as ſpiritual, as naked as I have gone among you, and that to you is the word of the Lord; The Lord is now come upon you as an armed man who doth work his mighty act by his power which is his right hand, overturning the ſafety that is not in him, bringing deſtruction upon them that crys peace, that are fat &amp; full, &amp; ſayes all is well, who ſayes no evil can come upon us, we have Church and Miniſtry, we profeſs the Prophets, Chriſt and the Apoſtles words; but ſaith the Lord, have not you priſoned unto death, them that be in the life of the Prophets, Chriſt and the Apoſtles? ſo do not I ſee your hypocriſie, can you diſſemble with me ſaith the Lord, who thus hath long diſſembled with men, making people believe that which you are not, making people believe that you are my Miniſters when you never heard my voice, &amp; I never ſpake to you, nor ſent you? think you not that my fury and indignation is againſt you? think you that the crown of pride ſhall reſt upon the head of the perſecutor, that he ſhall go on in his ambition, and ſay who ſees me, ha, ha, is not all our own? Is not all the Lords? am not I the Ruler of Heaven and Earth? can you hide your ſelves? do I not ſee it? have you diged deep to hide your councel, whereby your ends you would bring about upon the juſt? am not I a God of power? cannot I bring all things to light, and turn your bottom upward, and your inſide outward, and ſtrip you, and make you as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102136:5"/>bare and naked as him that is ſent amongſt you, who is your ſign and wondring ſtock, as though you had never read of the Prophets that walked in ſackcloath? yea, and naked as the Prophet <hi>Iſay,</hi> and as I have done, in <hi>Waltom, London, Colcheſter, Cambridge,</hi> and other Towns about, which was as death to me before I gave up to the ſervice of the Lord, which is a figure of all your nakedneſs, though I am cloathed on with immortality.</p>
            <p>This is to you which preach to the people for your mouths, and for your bellies, which is a ſhame unto you, for the ſhame of your nakedneſs the Lord is laying open, and you cannot hide your ſelves from his preſence, for the fire of the Lord is kindled againſt you, and the worm is gnawing in the conſcience which ſhall never die, and this will be the portion of all that forget the Lord and rejects his Councel, and hates to be reformed, and caſts his Law behind their backs, and will not take Councel at it, but kicks againſt it like wilde heifers not accuſtomed to the yoak, becauſe of you the Land mourns, who live in iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, lying ſwearing, &amp; all manner of prophaneneſs is found amongſt you, will not the Lord viſit for theſe things? will not the Lord be avenged on ſuch a Nation as this? conſider it now while you have time, leaſt the time come that you may ſeek to repent, and there be no place found; ſo become <hi>Eſau</hi> like, who ſold his birth-right for the earth, ſo was hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God, and ſo are all who are in that nature, who profeſs God and Chriſt, but are out of the life; the Lord ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors, and will not hear your cries, though you cry unto him, and uſe his name, but he hath not ſent you, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have not profited this people at all, as it appears by the wicked lives and converſations in all places; ſo the Lord is blaſting your works and bringing them to nought, for his decree is gone forth againſt the unrighteous; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this all who forget the Lord, and haſte to return, and ſeek him while he may be found.</p>
